# BUGS
An issue tracker for all the bugs found on the TTT servers.

If you find a bug for an additional mod (not AOF3, Adventure Pack, or Minecraft bugs), you can either send a message in the bug report channel on the Discord, or
create an issue here. If you don't, someone will, so don't worry about it if you don't have the time.

Note to devs: If you have patched an issue, just close it, you'll be assigned to issues for your projects.
